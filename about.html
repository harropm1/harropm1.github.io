            <h2>About Enjoy The Ride</h2>
            <p>Enjoy the Ride is a site for families, friends, or groups that will help them pick and rate their
                favorite Walt Disney World rides and attractions so they know what to prioritize on their trip.
                The goal is to help guests reduce stress while they are planning their trip and during their time at the
                park by knowing ahead of time what is most important and what can be skipped.
                By using Enjoy The Ride, various guests can rate the same ride multiple times, so if Mom and big brother
                love Mad Tea Party, and Dad and little sister think they might be sick when they go on it, all four of
                them will not have to wait for the ride while in Magic Kingdom.</p>

                        It was built on top of a series of tunnels and storage areas, so it is technically on the second
                        floor. This helps keep the six distinct lands in the park separate from each other, making their
                        theming unique.

                            <li>The first land, where guests enter, is Main Street, USA. On Main Street, USA, there is a
                                train station, city hall, shops, and restaurants. At the end of Main Street, USA is the
                                hub &#40;a circle where the spokes go to the other lands&#41; and Cinderella Castle.

                            <li>The next land to the right is Adventureland, which represents the mystery of exploring
                                foreign lands, inlcuding Africa, Asia, the Middle East, South America, the South
                                Pacific, and the Caribbean.</li>
                            <li>Next is Frontierland, where guests experience the American Old West, including cowboys
                                and the Rivers of America.</li>
                            <li>Liberty Square follows this and is themed after colonial America. The buildings follow
                                an architectural progression, from the late 1600s to the late 1800s.</li>
                            <li>Fantasyland, the next land, is the largest section of the park. It includes many of the
                                classic rides, but was recently expanded to include sections focused on Beauty and the
                                Beast, Snow White, and The Little Mermaid.</li>
                            <li>Tomorrowland is the last section, and is set in an intergallactic city that was based on

            <p>Michelle has been to Disney six times &#40;1994, 2000, 2010, 2012, 2016, and 2018&#41; with both family
                and friends. Her trips have included trying to get 10 people on a ride at the same time, and planning
                with two people who like rollercoasters and one who doesn&apos;t.
                This site came from a need to know which rides her friends and family preferred, so she could not only
                plan a basic route through each park, but also prevent backtracking.</p>
