            <h2>About Enjoy The Ride</h2>
            <p>Enjoy the Ride is a site for families, friends, or groups that will help them pick and rate their favorite Walt Disney World rides and attractions so they know what to prioritize on their trip. 
                The goal is to help guests reduce stress while they are planning their trip and during their time at the park by knowing ahead of time what is most important and what can be skipped. 
                By using Enjoy The Ride, various guests can rate the same ride multiple times, so if Mom and big brother love Mad Tea Party, but Dad and little sister think they might be sick if they go on it, 
                all four of them will not have to wait for the ride while in Magic Kingdom.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Magic Kingdom opened on October 1, 1971 and has six distinct lands. 
                            The first land, where guests enter, is Main Street, USA. On Main Street, USA, there is a train station, city hall, shops, and restaurants. At the end of Main Street, USA is the hub and Cinderella Castle. 
                            The next land to the right is Adventureland, which represents the mystery of exploring foreign lands, including Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. 
                            Next is Frontierland, where guests experience the American Old West, including cowboys and the Rivers of America. 
                            Liberty Square follows this and is themed after colonial America. The buildings follow an architectural progression, from the late 1600s to the late 1800s. 
                            Fantasyland, the next land, is the largest section of the park. It includes many of the classic rides, but was recently expanded to include sections focused on Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, and The Little Mermaid. 
                            Tomorrowland is the last section, and is set in an intergalactic city that was based on a 1950s concept of the future.

                        <p class="card-text">Epcot opened on October 1, 1982. It has gone through many changes, especially in the section known as Future World. 
                            Originally Epcot was supposed to be an experimental city, but Walt Disney was never able to get the funding for it.
                            Guests typically enter in Future World, where they are greeted by the iconic Spaceship Earth.
                            There pavilions to the left are based around science and innovation, while the pavilions to the right focus on the natural world.
                            From here, guests enter the World Showcase, which houses 11 pavilions, focusing on the culture, architecture, landscapes, and cuisines of those countries. 
                            The current countries that are represented in the World Showcase are: Mexico, Norway, China, Germany, Italy, United States &#40;known as The American Adventure&#41;, Japan, Morocco, France, United Kingdom, and Canada. 
                            Epcot also hosts many festivals throughout the year, focusing on food and drinks from countries all over the world, not just those in the World Showcase.

                        <p class="card-text">Hollywood Studios opened on May 1, 1989. 
                            Hollywood Studios has also gone through many changes recently, especially with the addition of Toy Story Land, and the upcoming Star Wars land. 
                            This park is dedicated to the worlds of film, television, music, and theater.
                            When Hollywood Studios opened, it was both a park and a production studio, with a functioning backlot and an animation studio. 
                            Many of these production locations, and the attractions around them, were removed in the late 2000s. 
                            Hollywood Studios also features 6 lands, including Hollywood Boulevard, Echo Lake, Grand Avenue, Toy Story Land, Animation Courtyard, and Sunset Boulevard. 
                            Along with rides, shops, and restaurants, Hollywood Studios offers more shows and live entertainment than other parks. 
                            Currently, the park is preparing for the arrival of Star Wars Land, which will add two more rides and more stores and restaurants.

                        <p class="card-text">Animal Kingdom opened on Earth Day, April 22, 1998. 
                            It is the largest park in the world, and is dedicated to the natural environment and animal conservation. 
                            Animal Kingdom has seven different areas. 
                            Guests enter in Oasis, which is similar to Main Street, USA and features animals in zoo-like exhibits, and vegetation and trees. 
                            This was done intentionally to separate guests from the outside world. 
                            Discovery Island is the central hub, and features The Tree of Life, a 145-foot, man-made baobab tree that includes 325 carvings of existing and extinct animals. 
                            Pandora - The World of <i>Avatar</i> is based on the movie series <i>Avatar</i>. 
                            The area features floating mountains, like in the movie, as well as alien wildlife and bioluminescent plants. 
                            Africa, the next section, is set in the fictional village of Harambe.
                            There are multiple wildlife areas in this section, including an 800 square mile area with a safari. 
                            Rafiki's Planet Watch is only accessible by train from Africa, and includes a petting zoo, animal habitat conservation area, and animal care facilities. 
                            Asia is set in the fictional kingdom of Anandapur. 
                            It includes details from Cambodia, India, Indonesia, and Thailand. 
                            This area also includes nature walks, as well as Expedition Everest, a popular roller coaster based around a Yeti. 
                            Last is Dinoland U.S.A. This land is focused on dinosaurs and other prehistoric life and
                            includes a playground, a casting of the most complete dinosaur fossil ever found, and a
                            carnival-style attraction area.

                                Her trips have included trying to get 10 people on a ride at the same time, and planning with two people who like rollercoasters and one who doesn&apos;t. 
                                This site came from a need to know which rides her friends and family preferred, so she could not only plan a basic route through each park, but also prevent a lot of backtracking.</p>
